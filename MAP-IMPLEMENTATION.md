# Map Implementation Plan

## Step-by-Step Map Development

### Phase 1: Basic Map Foundation ✅
- [ ] Create minimal working Leaflet map
- [ ] Test: Map displays with tiles
- [ ] Test: Map loads without errors

### Phase 2: Data Integration ✅  
- [ ] Show simple markers from API data
- [ ] Test: Markers appear on map
- [ ] Test: Data flows from API to map

### Phase 3: Marker Styling ✅
- [ ] Add colored markers based on status
- [ ] Add popups with report details
- [ ] Test: Markers have correct colors and popups

### Phase 4: Heatmap Layer ⏳
- [ ] Add basic heatmap visualization 
- [ ] Test: Heatmap appears at city zoom level
- [ ] Test: Heatmap data renders correctly

### Phase 5: Marker Clustering ⏳
- [ ] Add marker clustering for mid-zoom levels
- [ ] Test: Clusters appear and function correctly
- [ ] Test: Clusters expand to individual markers

### Phase 6: Zoom-Based Switching ⏳
- [ ] Implement zoom-level based layer switching
- [ ] Test: Proper transitions between layers
- [ ] Test: Performance at different zoom levels

## Current Status
Working on: Phase 1 - Starting completely fresh

## Issues Encountered
1. Complex existing code causing deployment failures
2. Multiple plugin loading and timing issues
3. Layer management conflicts

## Solution
Start with minimal working map and build incrementally, testing each phase.
